/* -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    every actor like actix actors must have some message structs to send pre defined message
    to other actors or send message from different parts of the app to the actor also it must
    contains a handler to handle the incoming messages or streams and respond the caller with
    appropriate message, node.proto is an actor which contains message structs and service 
    handlers NodeService handler contains a method called verify which can be used to handle 
    incoming requests and send a response back to the caller, we're implementing the NodeService 
    handlder trait for the NodeServer struct in here which allows us to handle and accept the 
    requests and send tonic response directly back to the caller of the verify method, for every
    service handler in proto file we have to implement the trait in here for the server struct
    so client can call the methods directly.

    each service in protobuf is a trait in rust which allows us to implement it for any server 
    struct and overwrite its handler methods to accept rpc request in form of single structure
    or streaming and sequencing of data structures.
