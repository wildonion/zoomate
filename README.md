‚ò¢Ô∏è Actor based proxy and balancer for audio and video realtiming process which can be loaded from the linux kernel using **BPF** technology

## ‚ú® Features

* **Cap'n Proto** as the serialization protocol

* Communication (video and audio streaming) over **ZMQ** and **RPC** based on pub/sub messaging pattern 
 
* **WebRTC**, **ffmpeg** and **GStreamer** for audio and video streaming, codec and compressing

* **P2P** streaming using **gossipsub** and **kademlia** protocols

* **Actor** and **BPF** based engine on top of **Tokio** multithreading tools (`TcpListener`, `spawn`, `select`, `Arc`, `Mutex`, `RwLock` and jobq channels)
